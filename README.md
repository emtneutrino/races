SAMPLE TRACKS
-------------
If permission to edit tracks and register races is given or is not required, the sample tracks will be available for you to load.  There are six sample tracks:  '00', '01', '02', '03', '04' and '05' saved in the public tracks list.  You can load sample track '00' by typing **`/races loadPublic 00`**.  To use the loaded track in a race, you need to register the race by typing **`/races register`**.  Go to the registration waypoint of the race indicated by a purple circled star blip on the waypoint map and a purple cylinder checkpoint in the world.  When prompted to join, type 'E' or press right DPAD to join.  Wait for other people to join if you want, then type **`/races start`**.

There are backups of the sample tracks in the **`sampletracks/`** folder with the extension '.json'.  Track '00' is backed up as **`sampletracks/00.json`**.  If any of the sample tracks were deleted from the public list of tracks, you can restore them.  Copy the deleted track from the **`sampletracks/`** folder to the **`resources/races/`** folder.  In the server console, type **`races import 00`** to import track '00' back into the public tracks list.

QUICK GUIDE FOR RACE CREATORS
-----------------------------
If permission to edit tracks and register races is given or is not required, all the following **`/races`** commands are permitted.  Type **`/races edit`** until you see the message **`Editing started`**.  Add at least 2 waypoints on the waypoint map or in the world by pressing 'Enter' on a keyboard, 'A' button on an Xbox controller or 'Cross' button on a DualShock controller.  Type **`/races edit`** again until you see the message **`Editing stopped`**.  Save the track if you want by typing **`/races save mytrack`**.  Register your race by typing **`/races register`**.  At the starting waypoint of the track, a purple circled star blip will appear on the waypoint map and a purple cylinder checkpoint will appear in the world.  This is the registration waypoint which all players will see.  Players who want to join, maybe including yourself, need to have enough funds to pay for the buy-in and move towards the registration waypoint until prompted to join.  Once prompted to join, type 'E' or press right DPAD to join.  Once other people have joined, you can start the race by typing **`/races start`**.

QUICK GUIDE FOR RACING
----------------------
There are seven possible types of race you can join:  1. Any vehicle can be used, 2. Restricted to a specific vehicle, 3. Restricted to a specific vehicle class, 4. Vehicles change randomly every lap, 5. Vehicles change randomly every lap and racers start in a specified vehicle, 6. Vehicles change randomly every lap to one in a specific class, 7. Vehicles change randomly every lap to one in a specific class and racers start in a specified vehicle.  For race types 4, 5, 6 and 7, buy-in amounts will be set to 0 and there will be no payouts.

Look for purple circled star blips on the waypoint map.  There will be corresponding purple cylinder checkpoints in the world.  The label for the blip in the waypoint map will indicate the player who registered the race, the buy-in amount, if AI drivers are allowed and the type of race.

If the race allows AI drivers to be added, the label will include **'AI allowed'**.  The person who registered the race can add as many AI drivers as they like.

If the race is restricted to a specific vehicle, the label will include **'using [vehicle]'** where [vehicle] is the name of the restricted vehicle.  You must be in that vehicle when prompted to join the race.  If permission to spawn vehicles is given or not required, you can spawn the restricted vehicle by typing **`/races spawn [vehicle]`** where [vehicle] is the restricted vehicle.  For example, if the label shows **using 'adder'**, you can spawn the vehicle by typing **`/races spawn adder`**.

If the race is restricted to a specific vehicle class, the label will include **'using [class] vehicle class'** where [class] is the vehicle class.  The class number will be in parentheses.  You must be in a vehicle of that class when prompted to join the race.  If the class is Custom (-1), you can view which vehicles are allowed in the race by getting out of any vehicle you are in, walking into the registration waypoint on foot and trying to join the race.  The chat window will list which vehicles you can use in the class Custom (-1) race.  If the class is not Custom (-1), you can list vehicles in the class by typing **`/races lvehicles [class]`** where [class] is the vehicle class number.

If the race changes vehicles randomly every lap, the label will include **'using random vehicles'**.  If a vehicle is specified after the **'using random vehicles'** message, racers will be placed in the specified vehicle when the race starts.

If the race changes vehicles randomly every lap to one of a specific class, the label will include **'using random [class] vehicle class'** where [class] is the vehicle class.  The class number will be in parentheses.  If a vehicle is specified after the **'using random [class] vehicle class'** message, racers will be placed in the specified vehicle when the race starts.

To join a race, you must have enough funds to pay for the buy-in amount.  You can check how much funds you have by typing **`/races funds`**.

Move towards the registration waypoint until you are prompted to join.  Type 'E' or press right DPAD to join.  The player who registered the race will be the one who starts the race.  Once they start the race, your vehicle will be frozen until the start delay has expired and the race has officially begun.  Follow the checkpoints until the finish.  The results of the race will be broadcast to all racers who joined.  Prize money will be distributed to all finishers.  If you want to see the results again, type **`/races results`**.

CLIENT COMMAND DETAILS
----------------------
Type **`/races`** to see the list of available **`/races`** commands.  If you cannot see all the commands, type 'T' for chat and use the 'Page Up' and 'Page Down' keys to scroll.  Type 'Esc' when done.

By default, permission is not required to use any of the commands.  If permission is required, there are 3 types of permissions that can be given: edit tracks, register races and spawn vehicles.

If permission is required to edit tracks, the following commands will be restricted to players who have permission:

**`/races edit`**\
**`/races reverse`**\
**`/races save [name]`**\
**`/races overwrite [name]`**\
**`/races delete [name]`**\
**`/races savePublic [name]`**\
**`/races overwritePublic [name]`**\
**`/races deletePublic [name]`**

If permission is required to register races, the following commands will be restricted to players who have permission:

**`/races register (buy-in) (laps) (DNF timeout) (allow AI)`**\
**`/races register (buy-in) (laps) (DNF timeout) (allow AI) rest [vehicle]`**\
**`/races register (buy-in) (laps) (DNF timeout) (allow AI) class [class] (filename)`**\
**`/races register (buy-in) (laps) (DNF timeout) (allow AI) rand (filename) (class) (vehicle)`**\
**`/races unregister`**\
**`/races start (delay)`**\
**`/races ai add [name]`**\
**`/races ai delete (name)`**\
**`/races ai spawn [name] (vehicle)`**\
**`/races ai list`**\
**`/races ai loadGrp [name]`**\
**`/races ai saveGrp [name]`**\
**`/races ai overwriteGrp [name]`**\
**`/races ai deleteGrp [name]`**\
**`/races ai listGrp`**\
**`/races ai loadGrpPub [name]`**\
**`/races ai saveGrpPub [name]`**\
**`/races ai overwriteGrpPub [name]`**\
**`/races ai deleteGrpPub [name]`**\
**`/races ai listGrpPub`**

If permission is required to spawn vehicles, the following command will be restricted to players who have permission:

**`/races spawn (vehicle)`**

If permission is required to edit tracks, register races and spawn vehicles, players who wish to do these tasks will need to request permission.  Type **`/races request edit`** to request permission to edit tracks.  Type **`/races request register`** to request permission to register races.  Type **`/races request spawn`** to request permission to spawn vehicles.  The server administrator will then approve or deny the request and the player will be notified.

Type **`/races edit`** until you see the message **`Editing started`** to start editing waypoints.  Once you are finished, type **`/races edit`** until you see the message **`Editing stopped`** to stop editing.  You cannot edit waypoints if you are joined to a race.  Leave the race or finish it first.

There are four types of track waypoints and one type of registration waypoint.  Each track waypoint will have a corresponding blip on the waypoint map and, when editing, a corresponding checkpoint in the world.  A combined start/finish waypoint is a yellow checkered flag blip/checkpoint.  A start waypoint is a green checkered flag blip/checkpoint.  A finish waypoint is a white checkered flag blip/checkpoint.  A waypoint that is not a start and/or finish waypoint is a blue numbered blip/checkpoint.  A registration waypoint is a purple blip/checkpoint.  When you stop editing, all the checkpoints in the world, except for registration checkpoints, will disappear, but all the blips on the waypoint map will remain.

Clicking a point on the waypoint map is done by moving the point you want to click on the waypoint map under the crosshairs and pressing 'Enter' on a keyboard, 'A' button on an Xbox controller or 'Cross' button on a DualShock controller.  'Clicking' a point in the world is done by moving to the point you want to 'click' and pressing 'Enter' on a keyboard, 'A' button on an Xbox controller or 'Cross' button on a DualShock controller.

Selecting a waypoint on the waypoint map is done by clicking on an existing blip.  This will turn the blip red.  The corresponding checkpoint in the world will also turn red.  Selecting a waypoint in the world is done by 'clicking' on an existing checkpoint.  You will be prompted to select the checkpoint once you are close enough.  This will turn the checkpoint red.  The corresponding blip on the waypoint map will also turn red.

Adding a waypoint is done by clicking on an empty spot on the waypoint map or by 'clicking' on an empty spot in the world.  Waypoints will always be added as the last waypoint.  You cannot make an added waypoint come before an existing waypoint.  The first waypoint you add will be a yellow checkered flag blip/checkpoint.  Subsequent added waypoints will be a white checkered flag blip/checkpoint.  Adding a waypoint will add a blip on the waypoint map and a corresponding checkpoint in the world.

**NOTE: The position number of a racer while in a race will be the most accurate if waypoints are added at every bend or corner in the track.**

You can delete a waypoint by selecting it on the waypoint map or in the world, then pressing 'Spacebar' on a keyboard, 'X' button on an Xbox controller or 'Square' button on a DualShock controller.  Deleting a waypoint will delete the corresponding blip on the waypoint map and the corresponding checkpoint in the world.

You can move an existing waypoint by selecting it on the waypoint map or in the world, then clicking an empty spot on the waypoint map or in the world where you want to move it.  Moving a waypoint will move the corresponding blip on the waypoint map and the corresponding checkpoint in the world.

You can increase or decrease the radius of an existing waypoint in the world, but not in the waypoint map.  There are minimum and maximum radius limits to waypoints.  To increase the radius of the waypoint, select the waypoint in the world, then press 'Up Arrow' on a keyboard or up DPAD.  To decrease the radius of the waypoint, select the waypoint in the world, then press 'Down Arrow' on a keyboard or down DPAD.  When in a race, a player has passed a waypoint if they pass within the radius of the waypoint.  The waypoint will disappear and the next waypoint will appear.

For multi-lap races, the start and finish waypoint must be the same.  Select the finish waypoint first (white checkered flag), then select the start waypoint (green checkered flag).  The start/finish waypoint will become a yellow checkered flag.  The original finish waypoint will become a blue numbered waypoint.

You can separate the start/finish waypoint (yellow checkered flag) in one of two ways.  The first way is by adding a new waypoint.  The second way is by selecting the start/finish waypoint (yellow checkered flag) first, then selecting the highest numbered blue waypoint.

To reverse the order of waypoints, type **`/races reverse`**.  You can reverse waypoints if there are two or more waypoints.  You cannot reverse waypoints if you have joined a race. Leave the race or finish it first.

If you are editing waypoints and have not saved them as a track or you have loaded a saved track and modified any of its waypoints, the best lap times will not be saved if you register and start a race using the unsaved or modified track.  A modification to a saved track means adding, deleting, moving, increasing/decreasing radii, combining start/finish, separating start/finish or reversing waypoints.  Changes can only be undone by reloading the saved track.  If you have not saved your waypoints as a track or you loaded a saved track and modified any waypoints, you must save or overwrite the track to allow best lap times to be saved.  **NOTE THAT OVERWRITING A TRACK WILL DELETE ITS EXISTING BEST LAP TIMES.**

After you have set your waypoints, you can save them as a track.  Type **`/races save mytrack`** to save the waypoints as **`mytrack`**.  **`mytrack`** must not exist.  You cannot save unless there are two or more waypoints in the track.  The best lap times for this track will be empty.  If you want to overwrite an existing track named **`mytrack`**, type **`/races overwrite mytrack`**.  **NOTE THAT OVERWRITING A TRACK WILL DELETE ITS EXISTING BEST LAP TIMES.**

To list the tracks you have saved, type **`/races list`**.  If you cannot see all the track names, type 'T' for chat and use the 'Page Up' and 'Page Down' keys to scroll.  Type 'Esc' when done.

If you want to delete a saved track named **`mytrack`**, type **`/races delete mytrack`**.

To load the waypoints of a saved track named **`mytrack`**, type **`/races load mytrack`**.  This will clear any current waypoints and load the waypoints from the saved track.  You cannot load a saved track if you have joined a race.  Leave the race or finish it first.

Type **`/races blt mytrack`** to see the 10 best lap times recorded for **`mytrack`**.  Best lap times are recorded after a race has finished if the track was loaded, saved or overwritten without changing any waypoints before the race.  If you cannot see all the best lap times, type 'T' for chat and use the 'Page Up' and 'Page Down' keys to scroll.  Type 'Esc' when done.

**`save`**, **`overwrite`**, **`list`**, **`delete`**, **`load`** and **`blt`** operate on your private list of tracks.  No one else will be able to view or modify your private list.  **`savePublic`**, **`overwritePublic`**, **`listPublic`**, **`deletePublic`**, **`loadPublic`** and **`bltPublic`** work like the private versions but operate on the public list of tracks.  All players have access to the public list of tracks.

You can clear all waypoints, except registration waypoints, by typing **`/races clear`**.  You cannot clear waypoints if you have joined a race. Leave the race or finish it first.

After you have set your track waypoints, you can register your race using the track.  This will advertise your race to all players.  Your track must have two or more waypoints.  At the starting waypoint of the track, a purple circled star blip will appear on the waypoint map and a purple cylinder checkpoint will appear in the world.  This will be the registration waypoint.  It will be visible to all players.

The registration waypoint on the waypoint map will be labeled with some information about the race.  The player who registered the race, the buy-in amount and if AI drivers are allowed will be shown.  If **'AI allowed'** is shown, AI drivers may be added by the person who registered the race.  If **'using [vehicle]'** is shown, the race is restricted to that vehicle.  If **'using [class] vehicle class'** is shown, the race is restricted to vehicles of type [class].  If **'using random vehicles'** is shown, the race will change vehicles randomly every lap.  If **'using random vehicles : [vehicle]'** is shown, the race will change vehicles randomly every lap and racers will start in the specified [vehicle].  If **'using random [class] vehicle class'** is shown, the race will change vehicles randomly every lap to one from that [class].  If **'using random [class] vehicle class : [vehicle]'** is shown, the race will change vehicles randomly every lap to one from that [class] and start in the specified [vehicle].  This allows racers to determine whether or not they can join the race without having to drive all the way to the registration waypoint.

Type **`/races register 100 2 180 no`** to register your race with a buy-in amount of 100, 2 laps, a DNF timeout of 180 seconds, do not allow AI drivers in the race and no restrictions on the vehicle used.  If you do not indicate the buy-in amount, the default is 500.  If you do not indicate the number of laps, the default is 1 lap.  If you do not indicate the DNF timeout, the default is 120 seconds.  If you do not indicate if AI are allowed, the default is no.

If you want to restrict the vehicle used in a race, type **`/races register 100 2 180 no rest elegy2`** to restrict vehicles to **`elegy2`**.

If you want to restrict the vehicle class used in a race, type **`/races register 100 2 180 no class 0`** to restrict vehicles to class Compacts (0).

If you want to restrict vehicles to a custom list used in a race, type **`/races register 100 2 180 no class -1 myvehicles.txt`** to restrict vehicles to class Custom (-1) which are listed in a file named **`resources/races/myvehicles.txt`**.  If you specify class Custom (-1), you must provide a file containing the vehicles you allow in the race.  You can add vehicles from **`resources/races/vehicles.txt`** to **`resources/races/myvehicles.txt`**.

If you want a race where vehicles change randomly every lap, type **`/races register 100 2 180 no rand`**.  Buy-in amounts will be set to 0 and there will be no payouts.  The randomly selected vehicles will come from the file **`resources/races/random.txt`**.  You can add vehicles from **`resources/races/vehicles.txt`** to **`resources/races/random.txt`** or remove vehicles from **`resources/races/random.txt`**.

If you want a race where vehicles change randomly every lap to one selected from vehicles in **`resources/races/myvehicles.txt`** that you created, type **`/races register 100 2 180 no rand myvehicles.txt`**.  You can add vehicles from **`resources/races/vehicles.txt`** to **`resources/races/myvehicles.txt`**.

If you want to increase the chances of a specific vehicle appearing, you can enter multiple entries of that vehicle in **`resources/races/random.txt`** or the file that you specified.  Blank lines in the file are ignored.  If there are invalid vehicles in the file, they will be ignored.

If you want a race where vehicles change randomly every lap to one selected from vehicles of class Compacts (0) in **`resources/races/myvehicles.txt`**, type **`/races register 100 2 180 no rand myvehicles.txt 0`**.

If you want a race where vehicles change randomly every lap to one selected from vehicles in **`resources/races/myvehicles.txt`** and racers start in an **`adder`** vehicle, type **`/races register 100 2 180 no rand myvehicles.txt . adder`**.  The period between **`myvehicles.txt`** and **`adder`** indicates that vehicles can come from any class in **`resources/races/myvehicles.txt`**.

If you want a race where vehicles change randomly every lap to one selected from vehicles of class Compacts (0) in **`resources/races/myvehicles.txt`** and racers start in a **`blista`** vehicle, type **`/races register 100 2 180 no rand myvehicles.txt 0 blista`**.  When you specify a class like Compacts (0), the start vehicle must be of class Compacts (0).

The different classes of vehicle you can specify are listed here:

-1: Custom\
0: Compacts\
1: Sedans\
2: SUVs\
3: Coupes\
4: Muscle\
5: Sports Classics\
6: Sports\
7: Super\
8: Motorcycles\
9: Off-road\
10: Industrial\
11: Utility\
12: Vans\
13: Cycles\
14: Boats\
15: Helicopters\
16: Planes\
17: Service\
18: Emergency\
19: Military\
20: Commercial\
21: Trains

As a convenience, each class of vehicle has been separated into different files in the **`vehicles/`** folder.  Vehicles of class Compacts (0) have been placed in **`00.txt`**.  Vehicles of class Sedans (1) have been placed in **`01.txt`**.  Vehicles of other classes have been placed in similarly named files except for class Custom (-1).  Each of these files contain vehicles taken from **`vehicles.txt`**.  Vehicles that don't seem to be in my version of GTA 5 are in the **`uknown.txt`** file.

If you want a race where AI drivers are allowed, type **`/races register 100 2 180 yes`**.  Only the person who registered the race can add AI drivers.  Buy-in amounts will be set to 0 and there will be no payouts.

To add an AI driver named **`adam`** at your current location and heading, type **`/races ai add adam`**.  This only sets the location and heading of the driver.  Move away from the location where you added the driver, then type **`/races ai spawn adam elegy2`** to spawn a driver in an **`elegy2`** vehicle at the location and heading you set.  If you do not specify a vehicle, an **`adder`** vehicle is spawned by default.  To delete an AI driver you added named **`adam`**, type **`/races ai delete adam`**.  You can delete the driver before or after you spawn the driver.  To delete all AI drivers, type **`/races ai delete`**.  To list the names of the AI drivers you added, type **`/races ai list`**.  If you want to ride as a passenger in the AI's vehicle, move close to the vehicle and press 'F' on a keyboard, 'Y' button on an Xbox controller or 'Triangle' button on a DualShock controller.

An AI group is a group of AI drivers that have been added and spawned for a race.  To save an AI group named **`mygroup`**, type **`/races ai saveGrp mygroup`**.  **`mygroup`** must not exist.  You cannot save unless all AI drivers that were added are also spawned.  If you want to overwrite an existing AI group named **`mygroup`**, type **`/races ai overwriteGrp mygroup`**.

To list the AI groups you have saved, type **`/races ai listGrp`**.  If you cannot see all the AI group names, type 'T' for chat and use the 'Page Up' and 'Page Down' keys to scroll.  Type 'Esc' when done.

If you want to delete a saved AI group named **`mygroup`**, type **`/races ai deleteGrp mygroup`**.

To load a saved AI group named **`mygroup`**, type **`/races ai loadGrp mygroup`**.  This will clear any current AI drivers and load the AI drivers from the saved group.  If the race type is restricted to a specific vehicle or a vehicle class, loading will fail if any AI vehicle does not match the specific vehicle or vehicle class.

**`saveGrp`**, **`overwriteGrp`**, **`listGrp`**, **`deleteGrp`** and **`loadGrp`** operate on your private list of AI groups.  No one else will be able to view or modify your private list.  **`saveGrpPub`**, **`overwriteGrpPub`**, **`listGrpPub`**, **`deleteGrpPub`** and **`loadGrpPub`** work like the private versions but operate on the public list of AI groups.  All players have access to the public list of AI groups.

AI group data is saved in the file **`resources/races/aiGroupData.json`**.

If you want to use the default value for some arguments of the **`/races register`** command, you can type '.' to use the default value for that argument.  For example, if you type **`/races register . 4 . . rand . 9`** the race will be a random race using the default buy-in amount (500), 4 laps, the default DNF timeout (120 seconds), no AI drivers allowed, the default file of vehicles to randomly select from (**`resources/races/random.txt`**) and vehicles of class Off-road (9).  This is the equivalent of **`/races register 500 4 120 no rand random.txt 9`**.

If you set the number of laps to 2 or more, the start and finish waypoints must be the same.  Instructions on how to do this are listed above.  You may only register one race at a time.  If you want to register a new race, but already registered one, you must unregister your current race first. You cannot register a race if you are currently editing waypoints.  Stop editing first.

You can unregister your race by typing **`/races unregister`**.  This will remove your race advertisement from all players.  This can be done before or after you have started the race.  **IF YOU ALREADY STARTED THE RACE AND THEN UNREGISTER IT, THE RACE WILL BE CANCELED.**

To join a race, players will need to be close enough to the registration waypoint to be prompted to join.  The registration waypoint will tell the player if it is an unsaved track or if it is a publicly or privately saved track along with its saved name, who registered the race, how much the buy-in amount is, how many laps there are and the type of race.

There are seven possible types of race you can join:  1. Any vehicle can be used, 2. Restricted to a specific vehicle, 3. Restricted to a specific vehicle class, 4. Vehicles change randomly every lap, 5. Vehicles change randomly every lap and racers start in a specified vehicle, 6. Vehicles change randomly every lap to one in a specific class, 7. Vehicles change randomly every lap to one in a specific class and racers start in a specified vehicle.  For race types 4, 5, 6 and 7, buy-in amounts will be set to 0 and there will be no payouts.

Players who want to join the race will need to have enough funds to pay for the buy-in amount.  All players begin with at least 5000 in their funds.

If the race is restricted to specific vehicle, its name is shown at the registration waypoint.  Players will need to be in the restricted vehicle at the registration waypoint in order to join the race.  Players can spawn the restricted vehicle by typing **`/races spawn [vehicle]`** where [vehicle] is the restricted vehicle name.

If the race is restricted to a specific vehicle class, the class name and number is shown at the registration waypoint.  You must be in a vehicle of the restricted class to join the race.  If the class is Custom (-1), you can view which vehicles are allowed in the race by getting out of any vehicle you are in, walking into the registration waypoint on foot and trying to join the race.  The chat window will list which vehicles you can use in the class Custom (-1) race.  If the class is not Custom (-1), you can list vehicles of the class by typing **`/races lvehicles [class]`** where [class] is the vehicle class number.

To join the race, type 'E' or press right DPAD.  Joining the race will clear any waypoints you previously set and load the track waypoints.  **NOTE THAT YOU CANNOT JOIN A RACE IF YOU ARE EDITING WAYPOINTS.  STOP EDITING FIRST.**  You can only join one race at a time.  If you want to join another race, leave your current one first.  **IF YOU DO NOT JOIN THE RACE YOU REGISTERED, YOU WILL NOT SEE THE RESULTS OF THE RACE.**

To list all competitors in the race that you joined, type **`/races rivals`**.  You will not be able to see competitors if you have not joined a race.  If you cannot see all the competitors, type 'T' for chat and use the 'Page Up' and 'Page Down' keys to scroll.  Type 'Esc' when done.

To respawn at the last waypoint the player has passed in a race type **`/races respawn`**.  You can also press 'X' on a keyboard, 'A' button on an Xbox controller or 'Cross' button on a DualShock controller for one second to respawn.  You can only respawn if you are currently in a race.

Once everyone who wants to join your registered race have joined, you can start the race.  Type **`/races start 10`** to start the race with a delay of 10 seconds before the actual start.  If you do not indicate a delay, the default is 30 seconds.  The minimum delay allowed is 5 seconds.  Any vehicles the players are in will be frozen until after the delay expires.  After the race has started, your race advertisement will be removed from all players.  The position of all human players and AI drivers will show up as green blips on the minimap and waypoint map.

The current race waypoint will have a yellow cylinder checkpoint appear in the world.  It will have an arrow indicating the direction of the next waypoint.  If a restricted vehicle or vehicle class was specified at the race registration waypoint, you will need to be in the restricted vehicle or a vehicle of the specified class when passing the waypoint to make the next waypoint appear.  If a restricted vehicle or vehicle class was not specified, you can pass the waypoint in any vehicle or on foot to make the next waypoint appear.  Once you pass the waypoint, it will disappear, a sound will play and the next waypoint will appear in the world.  Only the next three waypoints will be shown on the minimap at a time.  A blue route will be shown in your minimap to the current race waypoint.  Once you pass the current waypoint, it will disappear on the minimap and the next third waypoint along the route will appear on the minimap.  Once you leave or finish the race, all the race waypoints will reappear on the minimap.

Your current position, lap, waypoint, lap time, best lap time, total time, vehicle name and speed will display.  If someone has already finished the race, a DNF timeout will also appear.

If you want to leave a race you joined, type **`/races leave`**.  **IF YOU LEAVE AFTER THE RACE HAS STARTED, YOU WILL DNF.**

After the first racer finishes, there will be a DNF timeout for other racers.  They must finish within the timeout, otherwise they DNF.

As racers finish, their finishing time, best lap time and the vehicle name they used for their best lap time will be broadcast to players who joined the race.  If a racer DNF's, this will also be broadcast.

After all racers finish or DNF, the race results will be broadcast to players who joined the race.  Their position, name, finishing time, best lap time and name of the vehicle used for their best lap time will be displayed.  Best lap times will be recorded if the track was a saved track and waypoints were not modified.  Race results are saved to **`resources/races/results_[owner].txt`** where [owner] is the owner of the race.

Racers are given prize money after all racers finish or DNF.  At the start of every game session, players start with at least 5000 in their funds.  If you are using the existing **`port.lua`** file, race earnings are not saved between different game sessions.  If you win prize money in one game session, it will not carry over to the next game session.  **`port.lua`** may be ported to a framework that does save funds between different game sessions.  The ESX framework may save race earnings from one game session to the next game session.  A port of the **`port.lua`** file to ESX is in the **`esx/`** folder.  Total race prize money is the sum of all buy-in amounts that all racers paid.  The prize distribution is as follows: 1st 60%, 2nd 20%, 3rd 10%, 4th 5%, 5th 3% and lastly, 2% is spread evenly among racers who finished 6th and later.  Racers who DNF will not receive a payout unless all racers DNF.  If all racers DNF, all racers are refunded their buy-in amounts.  If fewer racers finish the race than there are places in the prize distribution, all racers who finished will receive any left over place percentages split evenly among the finishers.  If you wish to distribute the prize money differently, you will need to modify the values of the table named **`dist`** in **`races_server.lua`**.  The declaration and initialization of **`dist`** is\
**`local dist <const> = {60, 20, 10, 5, 3, 2}`**\
You can change the total number of values in the table.  For the distribution to be valid, the following conditions must be met:  All values in the table **`dist`** must add up to 100.  All values in the table must be 1 or greater.  First place distribution must be greater than or equal to second place distribution.  Second place distribution must be greater than or equal to 3rd place distribution and so on.  If these conditions are not met, a message will be displayed in the server console in red saying that the distribution is invalid.  If the distribution is invalid, players can still race.  Their buy-in amounts will be refunded after all racers finish or DNF.

If you want to look at the race results again, type **`/races results`**.  If you cannot see all the results, type 'T' for chat and use the 'Page Up' and 'Page Down' keys to scroll.  Type 'Esc' when done.

To spawn a vehicle, type **`/races spawn elegy2`** to spawn an **`elegy2`** vehicle.  If you do not indicate a vehicle name, the default is **`adder`**.  A list of vehicles you can spawn are listed in **`vehicles.txt`**.  This list has not been verified to work for all vehicles listed and there may be some missing.

To list vehicles that can be used for any race, type **`/races lvehicles`**.  To list vehicles of a specific class, type **`/races lvehicles 0`** to list class Compacts (0) vehicles.  The vehicles displayed come from the **`vehicles.txt`** file which should contain every vehicle.

To toggle the display of the speedometer at any time, type **`/races speedo`**.  The speedometer automatically displays when you are in a race and disappears when you finish or leave the race.  The default unit of measurement is imperial.  If you wish to change the unit of measurement type **`/races speedo (unit)`** where (unit) is either **`imperial`** for imperial or **`metric`** for metric.

To view your available funds for race buy-ins, type **`/races funds`**.

Type **`/races panel`** to show the main panel.  Type **`/races panel edit`** to show the edit tracks panel.  Type **`/races panel register`** to show the register races panel.  All **`/races`** commands have a corresponding button and argument field(s) if needed.  Replies to the commands will show up in another panel as well as in chat.  To close the panel, type 'Escape' or click the 'Close' button at the bottom.

Leaving a race or finishing it does not clear its track waypoints.  If you like the track, you can save it to your private list by typing **`/races save nicetrack`**.

Multiple races can be registered and started simultaneously by different players.

SERVER COMMAND DETAILS
----------------------
Server commands are typed into the server console.

Type **`races`** to see the list of available **`races`** commands.

Type **`races export publictrack`** to export the public track saved as **`publictrack`** without best lap times to the file **`resources/races/publictrack.json`**.  You cannot export the track if **`resources/races/publictrack.json`** already exists.  You will need to remove or rename the existing file and then export again.

Type **`races import mytrack`** to import the track file named **`resources/races/mytrack.json`** into the public tracks list without best lap times.  You cannot import **`mytrack`** if it already exists in the public tracks list.  You will need to rename the file and then import with the new name.

Type **`races exportwblt publictrack`** to export the public track saved as **`publictrack`** with best lap times to the file **`resources/races/publictrack.json`**.  You cannot export the track if **`resources/races/publictrack.json`** already exists.  You will need to remove or rename the existing file and then export again.

Type **`races importwblt mytrack`** to import the track file named **`resources/races/mytrack.json`** into the public tracks list with best lap times.  You cannot import **`mytrack`** if it already exists in the public tracks list.  You will need to rename the file and then import with the new name.

**If permission is required to edit tracks, register races and spawn vehicles, the following commands administer these permissions:**

Type **`races listReqs`** to list requests by players to edit tracks, register races and spawn vehicles.  The format of each element of the list is **`[playerID]:[name]:[role]`** where [playerID] is the player ID who requested permission, [name] is the player's name and [role] is either **`EDIT`**, **`REGISTER`** or **`SPAWN`**.

Type **`races approve [playerID]`** to approve the request of the player with [playerID].

Type **`races deny [playerID]`** to deny the request of the player with [playerID].

Type **`races listRoles`** to list if permission is required to edit tracks, register races and spawn vehicles and list the players who have had their roles approved.  The format of each element of the list is **`[name]:[roles]`** where [name] is the name of the player and [roles] is a list of roles the player has which can be any combination of **`EDIT`**, **`REGISTER`** and **`SPAWN`**.

Type **`races removeRole [name] (role)`** to remove player [name]'s (role) which can be **`edit`**, **`register`** or **`spawn`**.  If (role) is not specified, remove all roles.

Roles are saved in the file **`resources/races/rolesData.json`**.

**IF YOU WANT TO PRESERVE TRACKS FROM A PREVIOUS VERSION OF THESE SCRIPTS, YOU SHOULD UPDATE `raceData.json` AND ANY EXPORTED TRACKS BY EXECUTING THE FOLLOWING COMMANDS BEFORE CLIENTS CONNECT TO THE SERVER TO USE THE NEW TRACK DATA FORMAT WHICH INCLUDES WAYPOINT RADIUS SIZES.**

Type **`races updateRaceData`** to update **`resources/races/raceData.json`** to the new file **`resources/races/raceData_updated.json`**.  You will need to remove the old **`raceData.json`** file and then rename **`raceData_updated.json`** to **`raceData.json`** to use the new race data format.

Type **`races updateTrack mytrack`** to update the exported track **`resources/races/mytrack.json`** to the new file **`resources/races/mytrack_updated.json`**.  You will need to remove the old **`mytrack.json`** file and then rename **`mytrack_updated.json`** to **`mytrack.json`** to use the new track data format.  You will then be able to import the track using the new track data format.

EVENT LOGGING
-------------
If you want to save a log of certain events, change the line\
**`local saveLog <const> = false`**\
to\
**`local saveLog <const> = true`**\
in **`races_server.lua`**.  The following events will be saved to **`resources/races/log.txt`**:

PORTING
-------
If you wish to port these scripts to a specific framework, such as ESX, you will need to modify the contents of the funds functions **`GetFunds`**, **`SetFunds`**, **`Withdraw`**, **`Deposit`** and **`Remove`** in **`port.lua`** to work for your framework.

An attempt to port the funds functions to ESX is available in the **`esx/`** folder.  Copy **`esx/port.lua`** to your server's **`resources/races/`** folder replacing the existing **`port.lua`** file.
